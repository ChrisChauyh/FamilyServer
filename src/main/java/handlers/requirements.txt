When registering a new user, your server will generate 4 generations of family data. When performing a fill request, your server will generate a variable number of generations of family data, with the default being 4 generations. This value must be 0 or higher. For reference of how many people you generate for a given value:

0 generations: generate person and event data for just the user
1 generation: generate person and event data for the user and their parents
2 generations: generate person and event data for the user, the user’s parents, and the user’s grandparents
Pattern continues with more generations

The test driver will only test your server’s fill endpoint with up to 5 generations of family data.

For each Person generated, you must generate a set of Event objects that describe important events from the person’s life. Events generated by the Fill service and generated during registration must meet the following criteria:

Each person, excluding the user, must have at least three events with the following types: birth, marriage, and death. They may have additional events as well, but we will only be checking for these three.
The user’s person object needs to have at least a birth event, and may have additional events, but we will only be checking for the birth event.
Parents must be born at least 13 years before their children.
Parents must be at least 13 years old when they are married.
Parents must not die before their child is born.
Women must not give birth when older than 50 years old.
Birth events must be the first event for a person chronologically.
Death events must be the last event for a person chronologically.
Nobody must die at an age older than 120 years old.
Each person in a married couple has their own marriage event. Each event will have a unique event ID, but both marriage events must have matching years and locations.
Event locations may be randomly selected, or you may try to make them more realistic (e.g., many people live their lives in a relatively small geographical area).

Your server must allow for any event type, not just the three event types used when generating family data during the Fill or Register services. For example, a load request may contain an event with the event type "Completed College", and your server needs to be able to store that event in the database.

To assist in person and event generation, there are JSON files provided in the starter project that contain name and location data that can be used during person and event generation.
